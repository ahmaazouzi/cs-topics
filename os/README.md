## What This Is:
- These are the notes I am taking while reading *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* by Remzi H.Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau, available [here](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP) and [here](http://www.ostep.org).
- The book is structured around three major concepts, hence the name. The topics are: **virtualization**, **persistence**, and **concurrency**. Each of the three major sections is divided further into smaller chapters that kinda tiny, no more than ten pages each.
- Each topic and subtopic probably revolves around a certain problem and steps to solve it. There are practical exercises and whatnot! There are also historical sketches explaining the evolution of operating systems, blah blah!
- These notes will be extremely terse, unless waffling on is of absolute necessity!
